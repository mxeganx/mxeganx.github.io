            My name is Megan Enes and I am currently a student at the University of Rhode Island  and this is my website!<br>
     On this website I will be able to broadcast all of my upcoming projects for my CSC106 class. I have never made
        a webpage before, and this is my first time doing coding so I am super excited! Throughout this semester we will create 
        different apps and javascripts and they will all be documented here. You can use the navigation buttons above to see apps
        and javascripts that I create throughout this semester. You can also click the about me button to learn a little more about me!</p>

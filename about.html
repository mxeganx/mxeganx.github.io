<h1> About Me!</h1><br>
        <p>  <img src="new york.jpg" alt="picture of me in new york" width="300"><br> 
            My name is Megan Enes and I am currently a sophomore Nursing major at the University of Rhode Island. I grew up in
        East Providence Rhode Island, which is about 40 minutes from URI, and I graduated from East Providence Highschool. My birthday
        is on July 22nd and I am currently 19 years old. When I am not busy with school or work I love being around friends, and I love traveling.
        Both of my parents are from Portugal, and I grew up spending my summers there, and my older brother just recently moved there!
            I am a first generation high school graduate as well as college student and my goal is to become a nurse practitioner. </p>

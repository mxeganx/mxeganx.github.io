            My name is Megan Enes and I am currently a student at the University of Rhode Island  and this is my website!<br>
     On this website I will be able to broadcast all of my upcoming projects for my CSC106 class. I have never made
        a webpage before, and this is my first time doing coding so I am super excited! Throughout this semester we will create 
        different apps and javascripts and they will all be documented here. You can also find an about me page on this website 
        where you can learn a little more about me! </p>
